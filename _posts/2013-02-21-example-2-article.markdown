Last night, during the [Mash Up](http://www.mash-up.fr/mashup.html) french initiative show, someone came to me asking for advice to start developing iOS apps. A lot of resources and great articles came to my mind, that's why I decided to bring my little contribution to the community by referencing those in this blog.

I'm currently aggregating all I can think about, to finish this article. Subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml) or [follow me](http://twitter.com/dulaccc) on twitter to not miss the final article release.
