My developer life started in high school, learning PHP. Please don't judge me.

Then, I registered myself for the online <a target="_blank" href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/">Stanford University's CS 193p</a> on <abbr title="iTunes University">iTunes U</abbr> to learn developing iOS applications. The course was made by Evan Doll (creator of Flipboard, working for Apple now) and Alan Cannistraro (former lead of the Facebook Mobile Apps Engineering team). This course focused on learning the iPhone OS 2.0 SDKs in depth.

I co-founded my first startup in 2012, today known as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wynd.eu/">Wynd</a>. Then started another startup initiative, under the company name <em>Sixième étage</em>, where we've created <a target="_blank" href="https://fov-app.com">FOV</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://360player.io">360player</a>.
